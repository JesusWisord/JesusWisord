## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm JesÃºs "Wisord" Duarte
I'm a Software Developer. I'm specialized in **Javascript** but **not** exclusive to this language. I want to become a Data Scientist and I love everything related to **technology, human rights and math**.

From time to time I write on my [blog](www.jesuswisord.com) about my experiences or things that I think are worth sharing. I'm an **LGBTTTI activist** in my free time. 

I have experience with *HTML/CSS, Javascript, React Js, Node Js, Express Js, Docker and Webpack.*

Let's chat sometime **->** [@JesusWisord](www.twitter.com/JesusWisord)
